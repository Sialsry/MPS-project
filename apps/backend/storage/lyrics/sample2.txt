Standard Only 힙합 - 랩퍼A

[Intro]
Yo, this is a test rap for the Standard tier
Only premium members can hear this clear
Testing the system with beats and rhyme
MPS platform working fine every time

[Verse 1]
Standard grade music playing loud
Testing API with the developer crowd  
Sixty seconds minimum for the reward
Every valid play gets properly scored
Database tracking every single beat
Making sure the system stays complete

[Chorus]
Standard access, premium sound
MPS testing, going around
API working, data flowing
User experience always growing

[Verse 2]
Reward system calculating right
Monthly limits staying in sight
Five thousand plays for the reward cap
Testing boundaries without any gap
Quality music for paying customers
Service level that always delivers

[Outro]
Test complete but the beat goes on
Standard tier access till the break of dawn
