Business Only 록 - 록밴드

[Intro - Guitar Solo]
*Heavy guitar riff*

[Verse 1]
Rock and roll all night for business tier
Exclusive access to the sounds we hear
Testing limits of the premium grade
Top-level service that will never fade

Electric guitars screaming through the night
Business customers deserve the best sight
API endpoints working at full speed
Serving music for the corporate need

[Chorus]
Business only, rock the stage
Premium service, new digital age
MPS platform, enterprise grade
Music streaming that will never fade

[Verse 2]
Server testing with the loudest sound
Business tier access, most exclusive around
Monthly rewards with the highest cap
Enterprise music without any gap

Database scaling, systems running strong
Business customers playing all night long
Quality service that you can trust
Rock and roll service that's robust

[Guitar Solo]
*Extended guitar solo for testing duration*

[Outro]
Business rock will never die
MPS service reaching for the sky
